Notes on the Expense Tracker Application

- color choices? Not really liking the brown / cream color scheme
- the buttons only are able to be clicked in very small portions of the button
	- expand the target area? make the whole button clickable? Is this a bug with tkinter?
- left panel, last button is blank
- top panel, top right button off the screen.
- whole right side is actually off the screen,
- mode of payment does not show the option you have selected when you click on it 
- once you click into the date field you have to tab out of it, you cannot click out
